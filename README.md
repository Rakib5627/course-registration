# How I managed the state in your assignment project.

The state is an object that holds information about a certain component. Plain JavaScript functions don't have the ability to store information. The code within them executes and dissapears once the execution is finished.
React state management is a process for managing the data that React components need in order to render themselves. This data is typically stored in the component's state object. When the state object changes, the component will re-render itself.
